Top down 2D RPG game in NES FF style
This project has been ongoing since my education.  I always faulter with graphics and Python/Pygame seems to handle sprites with ease, so lets try again !

## The story thus far
You awaken to sounds of battle.  A guard rushes into your room and informs you that the Crushbone Orcs are invading and your uncle needs help!
Of course you grab your gear and head out to help, but are not able to do much.  Your uncle falls in battle, his dieing words are for you to seek why the Orcs attacked

Grab your rusty sword, sew up that cloth tunic and set out into the world and discover why clans of Orcs are now coming at you!
Find out that there are others looking for a similar power ...
